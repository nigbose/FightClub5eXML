			<name>Charge</name>
			<text>If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, roll the weapon&#8217;s damage dice twice and add them together. Once you use this ability, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>

			<name>Equine Build</name>
			<text>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.</text>
			<text>	In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.</text>
			<text>	Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.</text>
