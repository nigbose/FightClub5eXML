		<text>An Alchemist&#8217;s Satchel is a bag of reagents that you use to create a variety of concoctions. The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials. </text>
		<text>	If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials.</text>

		<name>Thunder Cannon</name>

		<text>A Thunder Cannon is a ferocious weapon that fires leaden bullets that can punch through armor with ease.  Once fired, it must be reloaded as a bonus action.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
		<text>	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

		<name>Master Rune: Opal of the Ild Rune</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>This triangular fire opal measures about three inches on each side and is half an inch thick. The ild rune  -  the rune of fire  -  shimmers within its core. Grasping this object causes a split second of searing, fiery pain to pass through you. That pain quickly fades, giving way to a warming glow.</text>
		<text>	Ignite: (Simple Property) As an action, you scribe the ild rune using ash onto a flammable object. That object immediately bursts into flame. While it burns, the fire extends 1 foot out from the rune you scribed.</text>
		<text>	Fire Tamer: (Simple Property) As an action, you touch an open flame and scribe the ild rune within it with a hand motion. This causes the flame to immediately extinguish. For a large blaze, the fire is extinguished in a 10_foot radius around you. You can extend this distance by expending a spell slot when using the ild rune in this manner. The radius extends by 20 feet per level of the expended spell slot. </text>
		<text>	Fire's Friend: (Simple Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you have resistance to cold damage.</text>
		<text>	Combustion: (Complex Property) As an action, you scribe this rune using ash onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. The creature automatically takes 1d10 fire damage plus 1d10 fire damage per level of the expended spell slot</text>
		<text>	Flame Brand: (Complex Property) Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune using ash onto a melee or ranged weapon, or onto up to 20 pieces of ammunition. The weapon or ammunition gains a ghostly aura of yellow flame and deals fire damage instead of piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. </text>
		<text>	In addition, you can expend a spell slot while using this property to grant the weapon or ammunition a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot's level divided by three. </text>
		<text>	These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again.</text>
		<text>	Flame Stoker: (Complex Property) While you are attuned to this rune, your fire attacks are deadlier. Whenever you roll fire damage from an attack or a spell you cast, you can reroll that damage and use the higher result.</text>

		<name>Master Rune: Orb of the Stein Rune</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>This spherical chunk of granite is about the size of a human fist. The stein rune &#8212; the rune of stone &#8212;  appears on the orb as crystalline veins that play across its surface. When first grasped, the stone feels impossibly heavy, as if even a titan could not lift it. That feeling passes after a moment, allowing you to carry the stone with ease.</text>
		<text>	Indomitable Stand: (Simple Property) As an action, you scribe the stein rune onto the ground at your feet. Until you move, you have advantage on all ability checks and saving throws to resist effects that would force you to move. In addition, any creature that moves within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have its movement immediately end. </text>
		<text>	Stone Soul: (Simple Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you cannot be petrified. </text>
		<text>	Stone's Secrets: (Simple Property) As an action, you scribe this rune onto a stone wall or floor. You learn the location and size of all creatures standing on or touching that surface within 30 feet of you, though only for the moment when the property is used. </text>
		<text>	Crushing Brand: (Complex Property) Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune using dirt or crushed stone onto one weapon that deals bludgeoning damage. The weapon gains a ghostly brown aura, and bludgeoning damage dealt by the weapon ignores resistance and immunity. If you roll the maximum on the weapon's damage die or dice, the target of your attack is knocked prone if it is a creature. </text>
		<text>	In addition, you can expend a spell slot to grant the weapon a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot's level divided by three. </text>
		<text>	These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again. </text>
		<text>	Earthen Step: (Complex Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast meld into stone as a bonus action. You regain this ability after a short or long rest. </text>
		<text>	Overwhelming Bolt: (Complex Property) As an action, you scribe this rune using dirt or crushed rock onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 12+the level of the expended spell slot). On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 bludgeoning damage per level of the expended spell slot and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.</text>

		<name>Master Rune: Pennant of the Vind Rune</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>This five-foot-long blue pennant is crafted from silk and whips about as if buffeted by a strong breeze. The vind rune &#8212; the rune of wind &#8212; flickers across its surface like a shimmering cloud. Grasping the pennant causes you to feel a powerful gust of wind wash over you, tearing at your clothes and gear. Anyone watching you sees nothing out of the ordinary, and the sensation passes after a moment. </text>
		<text>	Comforting Wind: (Simple Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you cannot suffocate or drown, and you gain advantage on saving throws against poisonous gases, inhaled poisons, and similar effects. </text>
		<text>	Wind Step: (Simple Property) As an action, you scribe the vind rune in the air around you and immediately fly 20 feet. If you do not land at the end of this flight, you fall. </text>
		<text>	Wind's Grasp: (Simple Property) As a reaction when you fall, you can scribe this rune in the air around you to take no damage from the fall. </text>
		<text>	Howling Brand: (Complex Property) Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune in the air above one ranged weapon. The weapon gains a ghostly blue aura and has its normal and maximum range doubled. The weapon's attacks do not suffer disadvantage due to range. </text>
		<text>	In addition, you can expend a spell slot while using this property to grant the weapon a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot's level divided by three. </text>
		<text>	These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again. </text>
		<text>	Shrieking Bolt: (Complex Property) As an action, you scribe this rune in the air between you and a creature you can see while you expend a spell slot. The creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC 12+the spell slot's level). On a failure, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 bludgeoning damage per level of the expended spell slot, and is pushed in a straight line directly away from you for 10 feet per level of the expended spell slot. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed away from you.</text>
		<text>	Wind Walker: (Complex Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast levitate as a bonus action. You regain this ability after a short or long rest.</text>

		<name>Master Rune: Shard of the Kalt Rune</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<weight></weight>
		<text>This long, slender shard of ice is roughly the size of a dagger. The kalt rune &#8212; the rune of ice &#8212; glows within the shard. When first grasped, the shard emits a painful cold that leaves your hand and arm numb. That feeling passes after a moment, allowing the shard to be handled normally. </text>
		<text>	Frigid Touch: (Simple Property) As an action, you scribe the kalt rune on the surface of any volume of water. The water freezes in a 10-foot radius around the spot where you scribed the rune. </text>
		<text>	Frost Friend: (Simple Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you have resistance to fire damage. </text>
		<text>	Icy Mantle: (Simple Property) As an action, you scribe the kalt rune using water onto yourself or another creature. The water instantly freezes into a mantle of protective ice that does not hinder movement or action. The next time the creature takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, that damage is reduced to zero and the icy mantle is destroyed. </text>
		<text>	Freezing Bolt: (Complex Property) As an action, you scribe this rune using water onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. The rune freezes in place, and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12+the level of the expended spell slot). On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 cold damage plus 1d8 cold damage per level of the expended spell slot, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and its speed is not affected. </text>
		<text>	Ice Brand: (Complex Property) Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune using water onto a melee or ranged weapon, or onto up to 20 pieces of ammunition. The weapon or ammunition gains a ghostly white aura and deals cold damage instead of piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. </text>
		<text>	In addition, you can expend a spell slot while using this property to grant the weapon or ammunition a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot's level divided by three. </text>
		<text>	These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again. </text>
		<text>	Winter's Howl: (Complex Property) While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast sleet storm as an action. You regain this ability after a short or long rest.</text>

		<name>Abyssal Arcana</name>
		<text>Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd_level spell. </text>
		<text>	You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-_level slot. </text>
		<text>	At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.</text>

		<text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.")

The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options, described below. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials. </text>
            <text>	If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials.</text>

            <text>At 6th level, your research and mastery of your craft allow you to produce a mechanical servant. The servant is a construct that obeys your commands without hesitation and functions in combat to protect you. Though magic fuels its creation, the servant is not magical itself. You are assumed to have been working on the servant for quite some time, finally finishing it during a short or long rest after you reach 6th level. </text>
            <text>	Select a Large beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The servant uses that beast&#8217;s game statistics, but it can look however you like, as long as its form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following modifications: </text>
            <text>	 </text>
            <text>&#8226; It is a construct instead of a beast. </text>

            <text>&#8226; It understands the languages you can speak when you create it, but it can&#8217;t speak. </text>
            <text>	 </text>
            <text>&#8226; If you are the target of a melee attack and the servant is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use your reaction to command the servant to respond, using its reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker. </text>
            <text>	The servant obeys your orders to the best of its ability. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. </text>
            <text>	If the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the end of the rest. If the servant is beyond recovery, you can build a new one with one week of work (eight hours each day) and 1,000 gp of raw materials. </text>

            <text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist&#8217;s Satchel and pull out a vial of healing liquid. A creature can drink it as an action to regain 1d8 hit points. The vial then disappears. Once a creature regains hit points from this alchemical formula, the creature can&#8217;t do so again until it finishes a long rest.

				<name>Bard College: College of Satire</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king&#8217;s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand&#8217;s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm&#8217;s cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.</text>
				<text>	While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester&#8217;s barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.</text>
				<text>	For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester&#8217;s satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.</text>
				<text>	Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist&#8217;s treachery or exposing a baron&#8217;s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.</text>
				<text>	Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies&#8217; spirits while casting doubt into foes&#8217; minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</text>

				<name>Optional Rule: Wild Shape Forms</name>
				<text>Known Beast Shapes: </text>
				<text>	When you gain the Wild Shape feature at 2nd level, you are deeply familiar with three beasts of your choice and can transform into them. </text>
				<text>	To choose the three beast shapes, you first need to determine whether your druid grew up in a temperate or a tropical region, consulting with your DM. Then refer to the Common Beast Shapes table that corresponds to the region you selected. That table lists the beasts you can choose from, based on your druid level. The table presents the animals that a druid is most likely to have seen as a novice, to have learned about through mystic research, or to have a special affinity with. </text>
				<text>	Each time you gain a druid level later, you can choose one more beast shape from the same table you used at 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Gaining Beast Shapes:</text>
				<text>	In addition to the beast shapes you gain for free when you level up, you can acquire new shapes on your adventures. Do you see a dinosaur, a saber-toothed tiger, a giant eagle, or some other exotic critter that you want to turn into? This rule gives you a method for learning how to do so. It requires you to abide by the limitations in the Wild Shape feature (see the Beast Shapes table in the Player&#8217;s Handbook, page 66). </text>
				<text>	When you see a beast whose shape you&#8217;d like to learn, you have two options: </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Observation: </text>
				<text>	You learn the beast&#8217;s shape after observing its behavior for at least 1 hour and succeeding on an Intelligence (Nature) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast&#8217;s challenge rating. For this observation period, your vantage point&#8212;whether physical or magical&#8212; must be within 150 feet of the beast. If you previously spent at least 1 hour reading a scholarly work about the creature, you have advantage on the check. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Interaction: </text>
				<text>	You learn the beast&#8217;s shape after interacting with it peacefully for 10 minutes and succeeding on a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast&#8217;s challenge rating. For this interaction period, you must be within 15 feet of the beast, and if you spend at least a minute petting it, you have advantage on the check. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>	Either of these options can be assisted by magic. For example, divination magic can be used to provide safe observation of a dangerous animal, and a spell like animal friendship can lay the groundwork for peaceful interaction.</text>

				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of Spores</name>
				<text>Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.</text>
				<text>	These druids believe that life and death are portions of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death is not the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.</text>
				<text>	Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. However, these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.</text>

Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.</text>

				<text>The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure. </text>
				<text>	Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz&#8217;t and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard&#8217;s penchant for double dealing and treachery. </text>

On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>

				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spell Slots: </text>
				<text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: </text>
				<text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. </text>
				<text>	At each odd level, you learn an additional ranger spell of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </text>

				<text>Spellcasting Ability: </text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </text>

				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you. </text>

Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. </text>
				<text>	You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes. </text>
				<text>	Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you.

You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area. </text>
				<text>	At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion&#8217;s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time. </text>
				<text>	If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion&#8217;s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. </text>

				<text>	Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. </text>
				<text>	For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. </text>
				<text>	Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion&#8217;s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

				<text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to summon a creature made from shadow magic to serve you. As a bonus action on your turn, you conjure or dismiss your shadow familiar, which takes the form of a spectral creature. You choose the form you can create when you first select this subclass.</text>
				<text>	When you conjure your shadow familiar, it appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. As long as it is conjured, you can forgo one or more of your attacks when you use the Attack action to have your shadow familiar move and make attacks of its own, which use your Ranger spell attack modifier for their attack rolls. Your shadow familiar cannot move farther than 120 feet away from you.</text>
				<text>	The three forms you can choose from are listed below:</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Cat: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the cat move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier slashing damage, and the next attack made against that creature has advantage on the attack roll.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the cat&#8217;s claws with poison and have it leap onto a target within 30 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC or be poisoned until the end of your next turn and take 2d8 poison damage for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Raven: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the raven fly up to 45 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the raven with lightning and have it travel along a line 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. Each creature in that line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 lightning damage for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Wolf: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the wolf move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage, and the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the wolf with primal ferocity and have it release a piercing howl. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the wolf gains 1d6 temporary hit points for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.</text>

				<text>	That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost.

You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.</text>
				<text>	More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.</text>
				<text>	Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not.

This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.</text>
				<text>	In addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see

If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.</text>

As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.</text>

She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality.

of magic is usually required to rouse its
practitioners from their laboratories, academies,
and archives to pursue a life of adventure.</text>
				<text>	Known as savants, followers of this tradition
are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in
the application of magic. The results of a spell
are less interesting to them than the process that
creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude
toward those who follow a tradition focused on a
single school of magic, seeing them as provincial
and lacking the sophistication needed to master
true magic. Other savants are generous teachers, knowledge and good humor.</text>

				<name>Arcane Tradition: Theurgy</name>
				<text>A number of deities claim arcane magic as their domain, for magic is as much a part of the fabric of the cosmos as wind, fire, lightning, and all other primal forces. Just as there are deities of the sea and gods of warfare, the arcane arts feature their own divine patrons.</text>
				<text>	Such deities often have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.</text>

		<text>You summon a barlgura that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The barlgura disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</text>
		<text>	The barlgura is hostile to all non-demons. Roll initiative for the barlgura, which has its own turns. At the start of its turn, it moves toward and attacks the nearest non-demon it can perceive. If two or more creatures are equally near, it picks one at random. If it cannot see any potential enemies, the barlgura moves in a random direction in search of foes.</text>
		<text>	As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past 24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. The summoned barlgura cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.</text>

		<text>You summon a hezrou that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The hezrou disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</text>
		<text>	The hezrou&#8217;s attitude depends on the value of the food used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the hezrou, which has its own turns. At the start of the hezrou&#8217;s turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the food&#8217;s value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the hezrou and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check.</text>
		<text>	If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the demon is no longer under your control. The hezrou then focuses on devouring any corpses it can see. If there are no such meals at hand, it attacks the nearest creatures and eats anything it kills. If its hit points are reduced to below half its hit point maximum, it returns to the Abyss.</text>

		<text>You summon a shadow demon that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The shadow demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</text>
		<text>	Roll initiative for the shadow demon, which has its own turns. You can issue orders to the shadow demon, and it obeys you as long as it can attack a creature on each of its turns and does not start its turn in an area of bright light. If either of these conditions is not met, the shadow demon immediately makes a Charisma check contested by your Charisma check. If you fail the check, the spell no longer requires concentration and the demon is no longer under your control. The demon automatically succeeds on the check if it is more than 100 feet away from you.</text>

		<text>	The vrock&#8217;s attitude depends on the value of the gem used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the vrock, which has its own turns. At the start of the vrock&#8217;s turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the gem&#8217;s value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the vrock and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check.</text>
		<text>	If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the vrock is no longer under your control. The vrock takes no actions on its next turn and uses its telepathy to tell any creature it can see that it will fight in exchange for treasure. The creature that gives the vrock the most expensive gem can command it for the next 1d6 rounds. At the end of that time, it offers the bargain again. If no one offers the vrock treasure before its next turn begins, it attacks the nearest creatures for 1d6 rounds before returning to the Abyss.</text>
